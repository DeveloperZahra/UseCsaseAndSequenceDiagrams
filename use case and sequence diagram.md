# 🔍 USE CASE DIAGRAM

## 📌 What is a use case diagram?

In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), 
a use case diagram can summarize the details of your system's users 
(also known as actors) and their interactions with the system. To build one,
you'll use a set of specialized symbols and connectors. An effective use case diagram

⭐ Goals that your system or application helps those entities (known as actors) achieve

⭐ The scope of your system
