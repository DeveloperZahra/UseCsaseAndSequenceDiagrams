# 🔍 USE CASE DIAGRAM

## 📌 What is a use case diagram?

In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), 
a use case diagram can summarize the details of your system's users 
(also known as actors) and their interactions with the system. To build one,
you'll use a set of specialized symbols and connectors. An effective use case diagram
can help your team discuss and represent:

⭐ Scenarios in which your system or application interacts with people, organizations, or external systems

⭐ Goals that your system or application helps those entities (known as actors) achieve

⭐ The scope of your system

## 📌 When to apply use case diagrams?
A use case diagram doesn't go into a lot of detail—for example, don't expect it to model the order in which steps are performed. Instead, a proper use case diagram depicts a high-level overview of the relationship between use cases, actors, and systems. Experts recommend that use case diagrams be used to supplement a more descriptive textual use case.

UML is the modeling toolkit that you can use to build your diagrams. Use cases are represented with a labeled oval shape. Stick figures represent actors in the process, and the actor's participation in the system is modeled with a line between the actor and use case.

 UML use case diagrams are ideal for:

⭐ Representing the goals of system-user interactions

⭐ Defining and organizing functional requirements in a system

⭐ Specifying the context and requirements of a system

⭐ Modeling the basic flow of events in a use case
